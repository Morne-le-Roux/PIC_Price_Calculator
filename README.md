Basic App built mainly for practice but for practical use at my current job at a print shop.

The app first takes an input for a known price for a known size print. The sliders are locked to devisions of 10, but manual input can be made if you touch on the sizes.
Second, the app takes in input for the cost of the above measurements.
Third, the app asks for the custom size of the print the customer requested. The sliders are locked to devisions of 10 to account for paper wastage, but manual input can be made if you touch on the measurements.

Finally the app works by calculating the cost per cm2 of the first and second input, and applies that price to the third input, outputting a price that you can charge the customer.

Measurement Units and Currency symbols are left out to account for other countries. Imagination is key.
